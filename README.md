## Hi, I'm Dominik!

Thanks for visiting my profile. Here you'll find projects I develop in my free time and experiments I'm working on. Enjoy exploring, and send me a message if you'd like to chat!

I'm currently looking for new opportunities. If my projects interest you and you'd like me to join your team full-time, please reach out.
